        <h3>Mark</h3>
        <h4>Need</h4>
        <p class="type-two text-body-lg">
          The Cohen Group is a Northwest brand with a down to earth mentality and dash of idealism. Accompanied by the nature of a Real Estate firm, which is to invest in the value of an area and augmenting natural wealth with developments that foster healthy living.
        </p>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p class="type-two text-body-lg">
      We knew we were making a commitment and investment into the Northwest. We couldn't be more explicit than evergreen trees and a home built under the mountains. This created an at a glance recognizable Northwest real estate mark. Using clean and simple lines with modern geometry, touching on professional precision. We stayed true to our primary need to be recognizable and legibility even in the mist and downpours of the Northwest.

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Need</h4>
        <p class="type-two text-body-lg">
We needed a modern typeface that could be read from near and far and looked great in print and on the web.
        </p>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p class="type-two text-body-lg">
We chose <a class="link" herf="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato">Lato</a>; a clean open source, web safe font that looks great on every median the industry required. Our primary goal was to deliver information to our clients and community in a way that quickly informs allowing for intelligent decisions on their futures. The Lato family ensures that we meet all the accessibility needs of our audiences without sacrificing an aesthetically pleasing experience.

        <h3>Color</h3>
        <h4>Need</h4>
        <p class="type-two text-body-lg">
Being a Keller Willaims Team we had to use the trademark red. We needed a palette that could work well with the red but was uniquely Cohen Group.
        </p>
          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p class="type-two text-body-lg">
            Our core values of a grounded, straightforward approach led us to a refined off-black, and off-white compliments with a stable naval blue. A simple classic color palette driving from our desire to deliver consistent quality and strong investment opportunities.

        <h3>Cards</h3>
        <h4>Need</h4>
        <p class="type-two text-body-lg">
The Real Estate business is centered around creating relationships and delivering on the promise that you have a family's or investors best interest at heart. We needed business cards that said as much and more.
        </p>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p class='type-two text-body-lg'>
          To meet this need we designed cards that make impressions. Full bleed photographs so clients know who they are working with. Clear hierarchy of elements so the important elements are there at a glance. A paper weight that lets people know, if we take half as much care with business relationships, as with our business cards they are in good hands. For a quality of print, we knew just where to go and we put our job in the incredible hands of  <a class="link" href="http://moo.com">Moo</a>.

        <h3>Signage</h3>
        <h4>Need</h4>
        <p class="type-two text-body-lg">
Next on the agenda were glorious signs. We needed something our clients could recognize even in the worst Northwest weather. We took a survey of sign design on an international scale. Scouring the internet for legibility methodologies nation to nation.
        </p>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p class='type-two text-body-lg'>
          We kept a no-nonsense approach with a strong San Serif, complimented with good old fashion typographic hierarchy and decent white space so the most important information could be jotted down at 50 miles an hour in a down poor. We drove for high contract and a clear realationships between our elements so when our sign loomed out of the rain they knew who they were working with.
