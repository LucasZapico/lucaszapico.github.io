## About
The goal of the portfolio or rather digital identity project is to produce a central digital presence from which I can with greater control, showcase, and document productions.

## The Dream
This is far stretch from the grandiose infrastructure I am hopping to scale this into. It may be more accurate to describe this as one a training exercise and two a proof of concept of an aspect of the infrastructure I would like to produce.</br>
I want my digital identity to be driven from this node that is all content to be rippling out from this node rather then Facebook or Google+, instagram, Flickr etc...I want those node to drive traffic back to the porfolio.
